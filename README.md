### Definition of Machine Learning
A program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T & some performance measure P, if it’s performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  
T - task  
P - probability of improved performance  
E - experience  

### 3 Types of machine learning
1. Supervised learning - learns uses labeled training data.  Example predict house prices in portland.
2. Unsupervised learning - learns using unlabled training data.  algorithm finds structure. Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning. Examples: social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.  
3. Reinforcement learning - learns to take action by maximizing a cumulative reward.

### 2 Types of machine learning problems
1. regression - predicting a continuous value attribute (Example: house prices)
2. classification - predicting a discrete value. Example: benign/malignant tumor, fraudulent or legitimate financial transaction, spam or non-spam email.

### Terminology
Features - measurable property being observed. i.e. the input to a neural network. Feature selection is critical, you must pick features that correlate with output.  
-example: pixel brightness in image object recognition.  
-example: square feet for program that predicts house prices.  

Hyperparameters - the model’s parameters in a neural net such as learning rate, and regularization factor.	

Architecture - The structure of the network i.e. number of hidden layers, and nodes.
